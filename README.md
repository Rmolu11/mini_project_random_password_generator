# Random Password Generator (https://rmolu11.github.io/mini_project_random_password_generator/)
## Description
A small random passcode generator that prompts the user to enter the following information: 
    - The number of characters they want in their passcode
    - If they want to include lowercase, uppercase, numbers and special characters
It generates a password and displays it to the user.

The motivation is to further my understanding of the alert(), confim() and prompt() methods and their return data types. Two key takeaways were implemeting an event listener and grouping differnt sections of the code within functions and calling them within other functions and passing arguments.
